# Quantum - Very modular Java library!

Quantum is a simple library designed to load JARs (or what is internally called Modules).
If you run a compiled jar of Quantum, it will create a modules folder where you can place modules.

EXAMPLE MODULE COMING SOON (as in i just need to get this on jitpack rq and i can upload it)
