# Quantum - Very modular Java library!

Quantum is a simple library designed to load JARs (or what is internally called Modules).
If you run a compiled jar of Quantum, it will create a folder (./modules) where you can place compiled modules.

For example code go see [/ExampleModule/](https://github.com/AverseMoon/Quantum/tree/main/ExampleModule)
